### Description
Here you can see how to set up an express server alongside the game server.

```javascript
const { Server, strummuluServerFactory, socketIo } = require('strummulu-server');
```
you can get the `socketIO` instance from the lib itself.

```javascript
const expressServer = express()
    .use(express.static('public'))
    .listen(port, () => console.log(`Listening on ${port}`));

strummuluServerFactory(gameServer, socketIo(expressServer));
```

and use it on the same port to serve both the game websocket server and a website itself.

In this particular example you can also see how to define a custom Room and make it be generated by the gameServer.

```javascript
const Room = require('strummulu-server/Room/Room');
...

class ChatRoom extends Room {
    constructor(creator) {
        super(creator, null, config);
        // in this particular case the second parameter is null
        // because we do no need game Logic
        ...
```

and

```javascript
const gameServer = new Server({
    roomFactory: client => new ChatRoom(client)
});
```
