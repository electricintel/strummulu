### Revorbaro
Frontend developed in **React**.

Revorbaro is like Rock, Paper, Scissor but with a gun.

You can **shoot** only if you have a bullet loaded, you will have a bullet loaded if you **reload** and you can **defend**.

- 2 x **shoot** is a draw
- **shoot** can be blocked by **defend**
- if you **shoot** while someone else **reload**, you win.
